# Hero Shooter

Working Title

Guns, powers, kick ass.

Basic concept: Combine D&D 4th editions power system with Destiny's load out style. Your powers are based on a mix of abilities for your "class" and your weapon loadout.

Power types:

* At-will - Basic actions that let you attack or manipulate the field
* Encounter - Once per combat encounter, more powerful effects
* Powered - Uses a meta currency to do extra special attacks

Enemy damage should have "phases" undamaged hurt critical dead
